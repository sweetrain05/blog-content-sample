            <h2 id="impact-of-images">
                The Impact of Images on E-commerce Sales
            </h2>
            <p>
                Images play a pivotal role in e-commerce. According to research,
                <a
                    href="https://www.shopify.com/retail/store-signs-and-red-signs"
                    target="_blank"
                    >93% of consumers consider visual appearance to be the key
                    deciding factor in a purchasing decision</a
                >. High-quality visuals not only attract potential buyers but
                also significantly enhance conversion rates.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, creating stunning product photos can be a challenge.
                From coordinating photoshoots to hiring models, the process can
                be overwhelming for many businesses.
                <strong>AI technology simplifies this process</strong> by
                providing high-quality photography that combines AI and fashion
                for e-commerce businesses.
            </p>

            <h2 id="good-images">Key Factors of a Great E-commerce Image</h2>
            <p>
                A good e-commerce photography shows the product clearly, fits
                the brand's image, and meets platform rules.
            </p>

            <h3>1. Clearly Displays the Product</h3>
            <p>
                High-quality images should
                <strong>highlight the key features</strong> of the product. For
                instance, a pair of earrings should be shown from multiple
                angles, displaying details like the clasp, material, and design
                intricacies. Additionally, showing how jewelry looks when worn
                helps customers gauge the size and fit.
            </p>

                alt="Best Photo for E-commerce_Multiple product photos"
            />

            <h3>2. Consistently Reflects Brand Image</h3>
            <p>
                Your images should
                <strong>reflect your brand’s aesthetic</strong>. If your brand
                is known for handmade, artisanal products, the images need to
                convey a warm, authentic feel. Consistency in style across all
                images helps in building a recognizable brand identity.
            </p>

                alt="Best Photo for E-commerce_Consistent brand identity"
            />

            <h3>3. Meets Specific E-commerce Platform Requirements</h3>
            <p>
                Different platforms have varying requirements for product
                images. For example, Etsy recommends using natural light and
                clean backgrounds. Shopify suggests using high-resolution
                images. Amazon image requirements include a pure white
                background.
            </p>
            <p>
                Making sure your images meet the platform's requirements can
                help your product stand out and attract more customers.

                How to Create Sales-Boosting Images
            </h2>
            <h3>1. Model Images</h3>
            <p>
                To create appealing model images, it’s essential to
                <strong>use models that represent your target audience</strong>.
                For example, if you are selling clothing on Shopify, it’s
                helpful to show how the product looks on various body shapes. If
                your target audience includes seniors, using senior models can
                make your products more relatable.
            </p>

                alt="Clothing displayed on different body types for E-commerce"
            />

            <h3>2. Product Images</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Keep the background simple</strong> to ensure the focus
                remains on the product. For instance, a simple white background
                can make a colorful scarf stand out more prominently. If the
                product's size is important, visually demonstrate it by showing
                a bag being worn, for example. This provides a clear perspective
                on the product’s actual size, helping customers make informed
                decisions.

            <h3>2. Flatlay Apparel to Fashion Model</h3>
            <p>
                Do you only have pictures of garments laid flat? There's no need
                to search for 'product photographer near me' anymore.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can effortlessly
                <a href="https://vmake.ai/ai-model-flatlay" target="_blank"

                Vmake.ai also helps in creating product photography without
                worrying about product photography fees and finding a commercial
                product photographer. Here’s how:
            </p>

            <h3>1. Background Removal</h3>
            <p>
                <a
                    href="https://vmake.ai/image-background-remover"
                    target="_blank"
                    >Remove backgrounds</a
                >
                with just one click. If your product photo has a messy
                background, you can effortlessly clear it to highlight your
                product, making it more noticeable and appealing to customers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eliminating the background not only cleans up the image but also
                lends it a more professional appearance. This simple adjustment
                can significantly enhance the visual appeal of your product.
                With Vmake.ai, achieving this refined look takes only seconds
                and comes at no cost.
            </p>

            />

            <h3>2. Customize Background</h3>
            <p>
                <a

                    >Change backgrounds</a
                >
                to match your brand and product photography with one click,
                offering various customization options. If you sell glass cups,
                you can make them look more appealing by displaying them with
                fancy table settings or flowers. This will attract more
                customers and increase sales.
            </p>
            <p>
                Adding decorative elements can enhance the overall presentation
                of your products. By creating an attractive display, you can
                entice customers to make a purchase.
            </p>
            <p>
                With Vmake.ai, you can
                <strong
                    >choose from 20+ background options categorized by various
                    mood and setting</strong
                >. Since the backgrounds are AI-generated, you’ll never get the
                same background twice. This means you can easily find the
                perfect backdrop that complements your product with minimal
                product retouching.

                Benefits of Using AI Tools for E-commerce Images
            </h2>
            <p>
                Using AI tools for e-commerce images offers numerous benefits:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Relate to Customers with Models</strong>: Using
                    models in product images helps customers relate more,
                    leading to higher sales. For example, a customer might feel
                    more inclined to purchase a necklace if they see it modeled
                    by someone who looks like them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Easily Diversify Your Models</strong>: Effortlessly
                    create diverse model images. You can show your products on
                    models of different ages, body types, and ethnicities. This
                    will make your product line more inclusive and appealing to
                    a larger audience.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Enhance Brand Identity</strong>: Customize images to
                    align with your brand’s identity. AI tools can help create
                    images that match your brand's style, whether it's edgy,
                    luxurious, or casual.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Lower Costs</strong>: Save both money and time by
                    using AI tools. Traditional photoshoots can be expensive and
                    time-consuming, but AI-generated images can be created
                    quickly and at a fraction of the cost.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These benefits not only streamline your process but also
                significantly boost your sales, both immediately and in the long
                run.
