                The Impact of Images on E-commerce Sales
            </h2>
            <p>
                Images play a pivotal role in e-commerce. According to research,
                <a
                    href="https://www.shopify.com/retail/store-signs-and-red-signs"
                    target="_blank"
                    >93% of consumers consider visual appearance to be the key
                    deciding factor in a purchasing decision</a
                >. High-quality visuals not only attract potential buyers but
                also significantly enhance conversion rates.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, creating these stunning product images can be a
                challenge. From coordinating photoshoots to hiring models, the
                process can be overwhelming for many businesses.
                <strong>AI technology can simplify this process</strong>,
                providing
                <strong>high-quality fashion model and product images</strong>
                without the logistical headaches.
            </p>

            <h2 id="good-images">Key Factors of a Great E-commerce Image</h2>
            <p>
                A good image is one that clearly showcases the product, aligns
                with the brand’s image, and meets platform-specific
                requirements.
            </p>

            <h3>1. Clearly Displays the Product</h3>
            <p>
                High-quality images should
                <strong>highlight the key features of the product</strong>. For
                instance, a pair of earrings should be shown from multiple
                angles, displaying details like the clasp, material, and design
                intricacies. Additionally, showing how jewelry looks when worn
                helps customers gauge the size and fit.
            </p>

                alt="Best Photo for E-commerce_Multiple product photos"
            />

            <h3>2. Consistently Reflects Brand Image</h3>
            <p>
                Your images should
                <strong>reflect your brand’s aesthetic</strong>. If your brand
                is known for handmade, artisanal products, the images should
                convey a warm, authentic feel. Consistency in style across all
                images helps in building a recognizable brand identity.
            </p>

            />

            <h3>3. Meets Specific E-commerce Platform Requirements</h3>
            <p>
                Different platforms have varying requirements for product
                images. For example, Etsy recommends using natural light and
                clean backgrounds, Shopify encourages high-resolution images,
                and Amazon requires a pure white background. Ensuring your
                images comply with these guidelines can improve your product’s
                visibility and attractiveness on these platforms.

                How to Create Sales-Boosting Images
            </h2>
            <h3>1. Model Images</h3>
            <p>
                To create appealing model images, it’s essential to
                <strong>use models that represent your target audience</strong>.
                For example, if you are selling clothing on Shopify, it’s
                beneficial to
                <strong
                    >show how the product looks on different body shapes</strong
                >. If your target audience includes seniors, using senior models
                can make your products more relatable.
            </p>

            <img

                alt="Clothing displayed on different body types for E-commerce"
            />

            <h3>2. Product Images</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Keep the background simple</strong> to ensure the focus
                remains on the product. For instance, a simple white background
                can make a colorful scarf stand out more prominently. If the
                product’s size is important, demonstrate this visually—show a
                bag being worn, for example. This provides a clear perspective
                on the product’s actual size, helping customers make informed
                decisions.

                Creating E-commerce Model Images at Low Cost Using AI Tools
            </h2>
            <p>
                With AI tools like
                <a href="https://vmake.ai/" target="_blank">Vmake.ai</a>, you
                can easily
                <strong>create professional fashion model images</strong>
                without breaking the bank. Here’s how:
            </p>

            <h3>1. Composite Virtual Fashion Models</h3>
            <p>
                Merge your products with virtual fashion models by
                <strong>customizing gender, age, skin tone, and face</strong>.
                You can even change the model's facial expressions and body
                shape. Need something unique for your brand?

                that looks exactly like your target demographic, showcasing your
                product in the best possible way.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Flatlay Apparel to Fashion Model</h3>

                    >Fit flatlay apparel images onto virtual fashion models</a

                worn and offers various styling options. If you've been unable
                to provide model shots due to cost and time constraints, now you
                can
                <strong>easily create and showcase them at a low cost</strong>.
                Imagine displaying a flatlay image of a dress and then
                transforming it to fit a virtual fashion model, giving customers
                a realistic view of how the dress fits and moves.

                <a href="https://vmake.ai/" target="_blank">Vmake.ai</a> also
                helps in creating professional product images. Here’s how:
            </p>

            <h3>1. Background Removal</h3>

                >
                with <strong>just one click for free</strong>. For instance, if
                you have a product image taken in a cluttered environment, you
                can easily remove the background, making the product the focal
                point.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Customize Background</h3>

                    >Change backgrounds</a
                >
                to match your brand and product image with one click, offering
                various customization options. For example, if you are selling
                glass cups, you can place your products against a backdrop of
                elegant table settings or natural elements like flowers to
                enhance the visual appeal. You can
                <strong
                    >choose from 20 background options categorized by mood and
                    setting</strong
                >, and since the backgrounds are generated by AI each time,
                you’ll never get the same background twice.
            </p>

                Benefits of Using AI Tools for E-commerce Images
            </h2>
            <p>
                Using AI tools for e-commerce images offers numerous benefits:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Relate to Customers with Models</strong>: Adding
                    models to product images tends to resonate more with
                    customers, leading to increased sales. For example, a
                    customer might feel more inclined to purchase a necklace if
                    they see it modeled by someone who looks like them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Easily Diversify Your Models</strong>: Effortlessly
                    create diverse model images. You can showcase your products
                    on models of different ages, body types, and ethnicities,
                    making your product line more inclusive and appealing to a
                    broader audience.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Enhance Brand Identity</strong>: Customize images to
                    align with your brand’s identity. Whether your brand is
                    edgy, luxurious, or casual, AI tools can help create images
                    that reflect your brand’s unique style.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Lower Costs</strong>: Save both money and time by
                    using AI tools. Traditional photoshoots can be expensive and
                    time-consuming, but AI-generated images can be created
                    quickly and at a fraction of the cost.
