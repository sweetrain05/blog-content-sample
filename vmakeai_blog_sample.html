                The Impact of Images on E-commerce Sales
            </h2>
            <p>
                Images play a pivotal role in e-commerce. According to research,
                <a
                    href="https://www.shopify.com/retail/store-signs-and-red-signs"
                    target="_blank"
                    >93% of consumers consider visual appearance to be the key
                    deciding factor in a purchasing decision</a
                >. High-quality visuals not only attract potential buyers but
                also significantly enhance conversion rates. However, creating
                these stunning product images can be a challenge. From
                coordinating photoshoots to hiring models, the process can be
                overwhelming for many businesses. For example, a jewelry
                designer on Etsy may need to organize a photoshoot for every new
                collection, involving substantial costs and time.
                <strong>AI technology can simplify this process</strong>,
                providing high-quality images without the logistical headaches.
            </p>

            <h2 id="good-images">Key Factors of a Great E-commerce Image</h2>
            <p>
                A good image is one that clearly showcases the product, aligns
                with the brand’s image, and meets platform-specific
                requirements.
            </p>

            <h3>1. Clearly Displays the Product</h3>
            <p>
                High-quality images should highlight the key features of the
                product. For instance, a pair of earrings should be shown from
                multiple angles, displaying details like the clasp, material,
                and design intricacies. Additionally, showing how jewelry looks
                when worn helps customers gauge the size and fit.
            </p>

                alt="Best Photo for E-commerce_Multiple product photos"
            />

            <h3>2. Consistently Reflects Brand Image</h3>
            <p>
                Your images should reflect your brand’s aesthetic. If your brand
                is known for handmade, artisanal products, the images should
                convey a warm, authentic feel. Consistency in style across all
                images helps in building a recognizable brand identity.
            </p>

                alt="Best Photo for E-commerce_Consistent brand identity"
            />

            <h3>3. Meets Specific E-commerce Platform Requirements</h3>
            <p>
                Different platforms have varying requirements for product
                images. For example, Etsy recommends using natural light and
                clean backgrounds, Shopify encourages high-resolution images,
                and Amazon requires a pure white background. Ensuring your
                images comply with these guidelines can improve your product’s
                visibility and attractiveness on these platforms.

                How to Create Sales-Boosting Images
            </h2>
            <h3>1. Model Images</h3>
            <p>
                To create appealing model images, it’s essential to
                <strong>use models that represent your target audience</strong>.
                For example, if you are selling clothing on Shopify, it’s
                beneficial to show how the product looks on different body
                shapes. If your target audience includes seniors, using senior
                models can make your products more relatable.
            </p>

            <img

                alt="Clothing displayed on different body types for E-commerce"
            />

            <h3>2. Product Images</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Keep the background simple</strong> to ensure the focus
                remains on the product. For instance, a simple white background
                can make a colorful scarf stand out more prominently. If the
                product’s size is important, demonstrate this visually—show a
                bag being worn, for example. This provides a clear perspective
                on the product’s actual size, helping customers make informed
                decisions.
            </p>

            <h2 id="low-cost-ai">
                Creating E-commerce Model Images at Low Cost Using AI Tools
            </h2>
            <p>
                With AI tools like
                <a href="https://vmake.ai/" target="_blank">Vmake.ai</a>, you
                can easily create professional model images without breaking the
                bank. Here’s how:
            </p>

            <h3>1. Composite Virtual Models</h3>
            <p>
                Merge your products with virtual models by
                <strong>customizing gender, age, skin tone, and face</strong>.
                You can even change the model's facial expressions and body
                shape. Need something unique for your brand? Create a virtual
                model that looks exactly like your target demographic,
                showcasing your product in the best possible way.
            </p>

            <img
                src="https://i.imgur.com/VNlyl39.png"
                alt="AI-generated Virtual Model for E-commerce"
            />

            <h3>2. Flatlay Apparel to Model</h3>
            <p>
                Fit flatlay apparel images onto virtual models. This feature
                allows you to show how your clothing looks when worn and offers
                various styling options. If you've been unable to provide model
                shots due to cost and time constraints, now you can
                <strong>easily create and showcase them at a low cost</strong>.
                Imagine displaying a flatlay image of a dress and then
                transforming it to fit a virtual model, giving customers a
                realistic view of how the dress fits and moves.

                Creating Professional Product Images Using AI Tools

            <p>
                <a href="https://vmake.ai/" target="_blank">Vmake.ai</a> also
                helps in creating professional product images. Here’s how:
            </p>

            <h3>1. Background Removal</h3>
            <p>
                Remove unwanted backgrounds with
                <strong>just one click</strong>. For instance, if you have a
                product image taken in a cluttered environment, you can easily
                remove the background, making the product the focal point.
            </p>

            <img

                alt="One touch background removal for E-commerce"
            />

            <h3>2. Customize Background</h3>
            <p>
                Change backgrounds to match your brand and product image with
                one click, offering various customization options. For example,
                if you are selling glass cups, you can place your products
                against a backdrop of elegant table settings or natural elements
                like flowers to enhance the visual appeal. You can
                <strong
                    >choose from 20 background options categorized by mood and
                    setting</strong
                >, and since the backgrounds are generated by AI each time,
                you’ll never get the same background twice.
            </p>

                Benefits of Using AI Tools for E-commerce Images
            </h2>
            <p>
                Using AI tools for e-commerce images offers numerous benefits:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Relate to Customers with Models</strong>: Adding
                    models to product images tends to resonate more with
                    customers, leading to increased sales. For example, a
                    customer might feel more inclined to purchase a necklace if
                    they see it modeled by someone who looks like them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Easily Diversify Your Models</strong>: Effortlessly
                    create diverse model images. You can showcase your products
                    on models of different ages, body types, and ethnicities,
                    making your product line more inclusive and appealing to a
                    broader audience.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Enhance Brand Identity</strong>: Customize images to
                    align with your brand’s identity. Whether your brand is
                    edgy, luxurious, or casual, AI tools can help create images
                    that reflect your brand’s unique style.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Lower Costs</strong>: Save both money and time by
                    using AI tools. Traditional photoshoots can be expensive and
                    time-consuming, but AI-generated images can be created
                    quickly and at a fraction of the cost.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These benefits not only streamline your process but also
                significantly boost your sales, both immediately and in the long
                run.
